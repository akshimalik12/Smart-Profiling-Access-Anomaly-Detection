# Smart Profiling - Frontend
This is a Vite + React + Tailwind frontend for the Smart Profiling for Access Anomaly Detection project.

## Quick start
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

The app expects a FASTAPI backend at http://localhost:8000 for detection endpoints.
